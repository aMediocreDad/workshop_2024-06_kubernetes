# Kubernetes Workshop - 2025-03

In this workshop we'll learn about Kubernetes and how to deploy applications on it. We will also cover ArgoCD and how to deploy applications using GitOps, as well as Helm and how Helm Charts work.

## Introduction

This repository uses Devbox to provide a development environment for the workshop. You can install Devbox if you'd like from here: [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/) (it's not required).

What you do need regardless of Devbox is Docker or Podman, minikube, and kubectl. You can learn about and install those tools by searching for them online.
